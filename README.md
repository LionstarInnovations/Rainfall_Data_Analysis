# Rainfall_Data_Analysis
A C++ program that accesses and reads the rainfall data of every month since 1930 from a file, storing the fields in suitable container, uses the data stored to find the wettest and driest years, the month which had the highest number of days of air frost, specification of file name on command line, well structured code (functions/procedures) and display various data statistics in various charts and graphs.  (Must be run on the command line specifying the 'sheffield.data' filename as an argument)

The sheffield.data file is part of a Met Office historical dataset from a meteorological station in Sheffield. It records minimum and maximum temperature (in â—¦C), days of air frost, rainfall (in mm) and number of hours of sunshine for each month in each year from 1930 up to 2012. (The data was obtained from data.gov.uk.)
